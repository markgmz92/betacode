Completed the question. However, there are still bugs when it comes to components.

Upon starting the app (npm start), it fails to compile and produces the error in the screenshot attached. To the best of my knowledge, I have followed the right React procedures. Create create an app using 'Create-app-calendar' and dividing parts of the calendar into components for ease of programming. 

I will try again later.
